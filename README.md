## Evaluation & Final Examination

- Data Project
  - group work
  - goals:
    - import some data
    - perform/replicat some econometric work
    - present result with nice plot
  - handled as a Jupyter Notebook (mixes text and code)
  - subjects proposed by myself and other professors
- Programming test
  - small coding tasks
